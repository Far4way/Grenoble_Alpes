To run any of the web server version, you first need to have "node" and "npm".
To run any of the server:
```
npm install
```
And then:
```
node server.js
```

To be able to use the complete version of the web server you need to have a mongodb database installed and running.
Instructions available [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/) for the installation.

Once the server has started, the interface is accessible by browsing to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## Web server
```
$ node server.js
```

## Arduino Programs

### How to?

To use the various files destinated for the Arduino microcontrollers, put the Arduino libraries inside the folder: \Arduino\libraries of your computer.

Then you can download the .ino file in your Arduino, and try it with the Pythie interface.
